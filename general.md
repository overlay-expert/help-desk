## FAQ

### What if the preview image looks different than my overlay in the builder?

The preview image is only there to help quickly identify your overlays; it is
not meant to be 100% accurate. Your browser, or even the inclusion of WebM
images may affect the generation of the preview image.

How your overlay looks in the builder is how it will look in a browser source or
in the extension.
